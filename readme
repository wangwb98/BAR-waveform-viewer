h1. Design

The goal is, collect every read/write access of core0.

* functions:
** dump_rw(), it returns the rw_list, each item in which will be (timestamp, addr, r or w). Its logic will be:
*** for each arvalid falling edge, get the araddr signals, put it into the r_list. (data should be rising edge??)
*** for each awvalid falling edge, get the awaddr signal value, and put into w_list.
